the better d2l. screw betterd2l.tech cuz d2lsucks.tech is best



D2lsucks (or BetterD2l) is the *better verison of d2l* which aims to make a simple interface for students to learn on. 
Currently, the site is mostly static with a iframe chatting system. In the future (with paitence and funding,) we would plan
to make a react JS version where the professor interacts with the GUI instead of the code. 

Goals: 
- Add gCal and sync due dates with adding events to gCal
- Making the website more appealing to the mobile side
- Adding more productivity tools
- Making the overall look of the website better
